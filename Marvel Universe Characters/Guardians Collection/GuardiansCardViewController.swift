He is highly vulnerable to attacks of fire.", pic: UIImage(named: "groot")!)

After being captured by the Kree, Rocket teams up with Star-Lord and other adventurers to form the Guardians of the Galaxy. Together, they travel the galaxy and defend it from those who wish it harm.", pic: UIImage(named: "Rocket_Raccoon")!)
